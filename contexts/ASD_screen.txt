What Is Autism Screening? 

Autism screening refers to the process of identifying individuals who may be at risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or who may exhibit early signs of the condition. The primary goal of screening is to identify individuals who may benefit from further, more in-depth assessments or evaluations.

Autism screening is usually administered by a pediatrician during a routine well-child checkup. The doctor may observe the child or ask you questions about his or her behaviors at home and while interacting with other children on the playground. The purpose of an autism screening is to identify common early signs of autism. The following are early signs of autism, however, they do not necessarily need to be present.

- Delays in communicating with others including speech and gestures 
- Not responding to one’s own name
- Getting upset over minor changes in routine
- Avoiding many, if not most, forms of physical contact
- Showing little interest in objects or people
- The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) suggests that autism screenings should be part of standard 18 and 24-month well-child checkups, whereas the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities  (NCBDD) recommends that all children be screened at 9, 18, and 24 or 30 months.  

Screenings administered during well-child checkups are only designed to indicate whether a child may be showing some early signs of autism. These screenings identify areas requiring further assessment and do not replace a formal diagnosis. Although many doctors follow the AAP and NCBDD guidelines, parents should also be proactive. If you suspect your child may have autism,  please ask your child’s pediatrician to administer screening or request a referral to a qualified specialist.
